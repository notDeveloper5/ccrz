SFDX

This is a quick and easy
deployment of a Lightning B2B testing environment using SFDX and shell scripts.
This repository provides configuration files and scripts that a Salesforce developer can use to setup a SFDX project in order to deploy the testing environment. The SFDX will include the metadata from the examples directory, converted to the SFDX format, and will have additional scripts for deployment steps supported only in the SFDX environment.
